# The Titanomachy!

**Let's take a journey back to ancient times when the new generation of Greek gods, the Olympians, battled the older gods, the Titans, in a remarkable 10-year battle, known as The Titanomachy!**

This 2-player, "Super Smash Bros" style fighting game transforms The Titanomachy into a futristic fantasy setting. **Play as Enyo, the God of the Underworld, or Eris, the Goddess of Strife, in this 5-minute duel to determine who is the ruler of your planet!**

Below you can find snapshots of various screens in the game, including the home page, battle countdown, and mid-game action!
